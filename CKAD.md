## Services :
- equality-based :
Filters by label keys and their values. Three operators can be used, such as =, ==, and !=. If multiple values or keys are used, all must be included for a match.
- set-based :
Filters according to a set of values. The operators are in, notin, and exists. For example, the use of status notin (dev, test, maint) would select resources with the key of status which did not have a value of dev, test, nor maint.

## 1 IP per Pod
- Containers X and Y Containers share the network namespace of a third container, known as the pause container. The pause container is used to get an IP address, then all the containers in the pod will use its network namespace. You wonâ€™t see this container from the Kubernetes perspective, but you would by running sudo docker ps
- To communicate with each other, containers can use the loopback interface, write to files on a common filesystem, or via inter-process communication (IPC). As a result, co-locating applications in the same pod may have issues. There is a network plugin which will allow more than one IP address, but so far, it has only been used within HPE labs.
- Support for dual-stack, IPv4 and IPv6 continues to increase with each release. For example, in a recent release kube-proxy iptables supports both stacks simultaneously.
