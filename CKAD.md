## Services :
- equality-based :
Filters by label keys and their values. Three operators can be used, such as =, ==, and !=. If multiple values or keys are used, all must be included for a match.
- set-based :
Filters according to a set of values. The operators are in, notin, and exists. For example, the use of status notin (dev, test, maint) would select resources with the key of status which did not have a value of dev, test, nor maint.
